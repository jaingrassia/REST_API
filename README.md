This is a Rest API that I have created along with CRUD operations.
/status checks the status of the server and if it is running
You can register, login, update your password, or delete your account using these CRUD operations.
Tagged is the CRUD file proving they all work
I used bcryptjs and jsonwebtoken to encrypt the passwords which can be downloaded in your console by doing the following commands
npm install bcryptjs jsonwebtoken
I also use express which can be downloaded through this console command
npm install express
If you have any notes or stuff I can work on email me at jaingras@syr.edu
